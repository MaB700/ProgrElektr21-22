\section{Solid color}

This module is our main setup for the display. It includes all timings necessary to display a solid color on our display with HD+ resolution.

\section{Patterns}

Here, we created two animated and three static patterns: an animated circle and a shifting colors pattern as well as a checkerboard, circles and stripes.

The stripes:

The shifting color pattern:

\section{Video memory}

This module comes with a preloaded image that is saved to the ram of the \gls{fpga} and then displayed on a screen. Therefore we used the init$\_$ram function of VHDL from the instructions. Before that, the image has been converted to a black and white image to meet the RAM limitations (max. 1.800\,Kb) of the \gls{fpga}.

\section{Video data from UART}

Here, we used UART to transmit data to the video memory of the \gls{fpga}. After converting a picture to a black and white image it can be transmitted with the terminal tool.
